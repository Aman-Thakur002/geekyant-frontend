# Frontend Refactor Summary

## What Was Cleaned Up

### 1. **Removed Redundant Code**
- Eliminated server-side code (server/, shared/ directories)
- Removed Replit-specific configurations and plugins
- Cleaned up complex type definitions
- Simplified API layer to work directly with your backend

### 2. **Backend Integration**
- Updated API endpoints to match your Node.js backend structure
- Fixed authentication flow to work with your JWT implementation
- Corrected user type field mapping (type vs role)
- Simplified data fetching with React Query

### 3. **Streamlined Architecture**
- Removed unnecessary abstractions and complex type systems
- Simplified component structure for better maintainability
- Clean separation of concerns (API, Auth, Components, Pages)
- Minimal dependencies focused on core functionality

## Key Files Updated

### API Integration (`client/src/lib/api.ts`)
- Direct fetch implementation with proper error handling
- Endpoints matching your backend routes
- Token-based authentication headers

### Authentication (`client/src/lib/auth.tsx`)
- Simplified auth context without complex type dependencies
- Direct integration with your login endpoint
- Proper token storage and management

### Components
- Clean, functional components using ShadCN UI
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Role-based navigation and access control

## How to Use

1. **Start your backend server** on `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Install frontend dependencies**: `npm install`
3. **Start frontend**: `npm run dev`
4. **Access at**: `http://localhost:5173`

## Demo Credentials
- **Manager**: manager@company.com / manager123
- **Engineer**: alice@company.com / engineer123

## Features Working
- ✅ Authentication with role-based routing
- ✅ Manager dashboard with team overview
- ✅ Engineer dashboard with assignments
- ✅ Responsive sidebar navigation
- ✅ Clean UI with gray/black/white theme
- ✅ API integration with your backend

## Next Steps
The frontend is now clean, minimal, and ready for production use. You can:
1. Add more features as needed
2. Customize the UI components
3. Add more complex business logic
4. Deploy to production

The codebase is now maintainable and follows React best practices.
